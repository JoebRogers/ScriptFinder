# Need a lightweight solution to finding script references within the project inspector? Look no further!
ScriptFinder allows you to find all prefabs within the project containing a selected target script within seconds, whether that script is attached to the GameObject itself, or nested within a child.

![](https://github.com/JoebRogers/ScriptFinder/blob/master/Images/screenshot.png)

# How to use:
Import the package using the steps here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html#ImportingPackages

Once you've imported the asset, using the tool is as simple as opening the ScriptFinder editor from the menu dropdown, selecting or dragging in a target script and pressing a button!

# You can also find me on the asset store!
